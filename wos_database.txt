AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has been attracting a lot of attention due to its extensive applications such as air pollution monitoring. IoT is based on end-to-end communications where each device independently delivers collected data. This leads to a lot of redundant data especially in the air pollution monitoring case where the data collected in a specific area is highly correlated. To suppress data redundancy and alleviate data delivery costs, we propose a Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution Monitoring (CIAM) system. In CIAM, the content-centric mechanism is exploited to perform air pollution data aggregation and delivery. For each type of content, a content-centric backbone is constructed so that the devices involved in the backbone can aggregate the correlated data and lower the data delivery cost and latency. CIAM is quantitatively evaluated, and the results demonstrate that CIAM alleviates the data delivery costs and latency.

AB Awareness of air pollution is one of the key aspects of modern smart cities. Policy makers, and other key stakeholders, are often ignorant of pollution in their immediate surrounding and its correlation to local environment and micro-climate when making short- or long-term decisions. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm provides a suitable general framework for monitoring air pollution as it incorporates a sensor network containing static and/or mobile sensors for measuring the different pollutants. IoT architectures, although very powerful, have a lot of issues and challenges that need to be addressed and in turn solved. In this paper a comprehensive summary of current trends in air pollution monitoring is presented. Considering the advantages of the existing solutions, a novel holistic air pollution monitoring architecture is proposed. A detailed analysis of its components is provided, including their characteristics, objectives and mechanisms to overcome the major issues and challenges.

AB Thanks to the recent advances of miniaturization and the falling costs for sensors and also communication technologies, Internet specially, the number of internet-connected things growth tremendously. Moreover, geosensors with capability of generating high spatial and temporal resolution data, measuring a vast diversity of environmental data and automated operations provide powerful abilities to environmental monitoring tasks. Geosensor nodes are intuitively heterogeneous in terms of the hardware capabilities and communication protocols to take part in the Internet of Things scenarios. Therefore, ensuring interoperability is an important step. With this respect, the focus of this paper is particularly on incorporation of geosensor networks into Internet of things through an architecture for monitoring real-time environmental data with use of OGC Sensor Web Enablement standards. This approach and its applicability is discussed in the context of an air pollution monitoring scenario.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide system of "smart devices" that can sense and connect with their surroundings and interact with users and other systems. Global air pollution is one of the major concerns of our era. Existing monitoring systems have inferior precision, low sensitivity, and require laboratory analysis. Therefore, improved monitoring systems are needed. To overcome the problems of existing systems, we propose a three-phase air pollution monitoring system. An IoT kit was prepared using gas sensors, Arduino integrated development environment (IDE), and a Wi-Fi module. This kit can be physically placed in various cities to monitoring air pollution. The gas sensors gather data from air and forward the data to the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE transmits the data to the cloud via the Wi-Fi module. We also developed an Android application termed IoT-Mobair, so that users can access relevant air quality data from the cloud. If a user is traveling to a destination, the pollution level of the entire route is predicted, and a warning is displayed if the pollution level is too high. The proposed system is analogous to Google traffic or the navigation application of Google Maps. Furthermore, air quality data can be used to predict future air quality index (AQI) levels.

AB Air pollution monitoring and control is becoming a key priority in urban areas due to its substantial effect on human morbidity and mortality. This paper presents a system architecture for intelligent pollution visualization and future pollution prediction by encompassing pollution measurements and meteorological parameters. First, a pollution model using spatial interpolation is built. By adding meteorological parameters this model is further used to identify the pollution field evolution and the position of potential sources of air pollution. Using deep learning techniques, the system provides predictions for future pollution levels as well as times to reaching alarming thresholds. The whole system is encompassed in a fast, easy to use web service and a client that visually renders the system responses. The system is built and tested on data for the city of Skopje. Although the spatial resolution of the system data is low, the results are satisfactory and promising. Since the system can be seamlessly deployed on an Internet of Things sensing architecture, the improved data spatial resolution will improve performance.

AB The data generated by the devices and existing infrastructure in the Internet of Things (IoT) should be shared among applications. However, data sharing in the IoT can only reach its full potential when multiple participants contribute their data, for example when people are able to use their smartphone sensors for this purpose. We believe that each step, from sensing the data to the actionable knowledge, requires trust-enabled mechanisms to facilitate data exchange, such as data perception trust, trustworthy data mining, and reasoning with trust related policies. The absence of trust could affect the acceptance of sharing data in smart cities. In this study, we focus on data usage transparency and accountability and propose a trust model for data sharing in smart cities, including system architecture for trust-based data sharing, data semantic and abstraction models, and a mechanism to enhance transparency and accountability for data usage. We apply semantic technology and defeasible reasoning with trust data usage policies. We built a prototype based on an air pollution monitoring use case and utilized it to evaluate the performance of our solution.

AB Air pollution is a perilous threat to living organisms and the whole ecosystem. The purpose of this paper is to develop a self-configurable air pollution monitoring system which can monitor and predict air pollution by applying Internet of Things (IoT) and data mining technologies. Self-configurability of the device is the ability to regulate the frequency of monitoring based on pollutant predictions. Monitoring is done using the system developed in paper [1] which collects concentration of pollutants such as Carbon monoxide, harmful gases, dust level, meteorological parameters such as temperature along with GPS location. This paper deals with using the monitored data for prediction along with humidity information. Data mining technique, Regression is used to predict the level of pollutant. These predicted values in turn decides the mode of operation of the device. The monitored data send to ThingSpeak are further analyzed using MATLAB.

AB The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the key enabling technology for transforming current urban environments into so-called Smart Cities. One of the goals behind making cities smarter is to provide a healthy environment that improves the citizens' quality of life and wellbeing. In this work, we introduce a novel data aggregation mechanism tailored to the application of large-scale air pollution monitoring with IoT devices. Our design exploits the intra-and inter-source correlations among air-pollution data using the framework of compressed sensing with side information. The proposed method delivers significant improvements in the data reconstruction quality with respect to the state of the art, even in the presence of noise when measuring and transmitting the data.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB This paper presents the development of high-performance wireless sensor networks for local monitoring of air pollution. The proposed system, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), is based on low-cost sensors collocated in a redundant configuration for collecting and transferring air quality data. Reliability and accuracy of the monitoring system are enhanced by using extended fractional-order Kalman filtering (EFKF) for data assimilation and recovery of the missing information. Its effectiveness is verified through monitoring particulate matters at a suburban site during the wildfire season 2019-2020 and the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown period. The proposed approach is of interest to achieve microclimate responsiveness in a local area.

AB In many countries, due to the exhaustion of industrial production and the exhaust emissions of a large number of fuel vehicles, air pollution problems are also increasing, which has a negative impact on the ecological environment and people's health. Reducing the impact of air pollution on people and improving air quality are inseparable from the monitoring of air. The following problems are common in previous air monitoring systems: large energy consumption, short-life, limited communication distance, and high maintenance cost. In this paper, an air pollution index (API) monitoring system was built using the Internet of Things technology and Sigfox low-power wide area network (LPWAN) communication technology to solve the above problems, and this air pollution monitoring system was tested at the University of Limerick.

AB Using empirical analysis, conventional air automatic monitoring system has high precision, but large bulk, high cost, and single datum class make it impossible for large-scale installation. Based on intriducing Internet of Things(IOT) into the field of environmental protection, this paper puts forward a kind of real-time air pollution monitoring and forecasting system. By using IOT, this system can reduce the hardware cost into 1/10 as before. The system can be laid out in a large number in monitoring area to form monitoring sensor network. Besides the functions of conventional air automatic monitoring system, it also exhibits the function of forecasting development trend of air pollution within a certain time range by analyzing the data obtained by front-end perception system according to neural network technology. Targeted emergency disposal measures can be taken to minimize losses in practical application.

AB The pollution due to the vehicles has sky-rocketed several risks not only for the organisms but has also disturbed the balance of the environment. In the past decade, the number of vehicles has increased enormously due to which vehicular pollution has only increased. hi most of the cases, the driver does not have the information related to the emission of the vehicle thus making it difficult for the driver to take the particular actions to get the vehicle repaired. So, in order to control the vehicular pollution, the 'Automobile Air Pollution Monitoring' model can be used. The model will help in detecting the vehicles which emit the pollution greater than the standard limit. Moreover, the data will help in analyzing what sort of vehicle type are the major contributor of the pollution and thus making proper strategies to tackle such vehicle problems.

AB Air pollution is the foremost concern especially in modern cities, because of its noteworthy influences on the community health, and the global economy. The significance of the air quality statistics makes the highly accurate real-time monitoring systems vital. The partial data access, high cost and the non-scalability of conventional air monitoring system enforce the researchers to develop future air pollution monitoring system employing advance technologies such as internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) and the low-cost ambient sensors. This paper presents a short but comprehensive review of these air pollution monitoring systems (APMS), their enabling technologies and protocols. We categorize the recent work into two main classes as static and mobile air monitoring systems based on the carriers of the sensing node and the deployment strategies. Sub categories include, portable monitoring devices, community supported approaches, WSN based systems, and IoT supported approaches. Broad performance assessments and the comparison among these categories were performed with respect to their architecture and the incorporated tools. Furthermore, the present study explored the issues, groundwork, and the methodology of designing a real-time air pollution monitoring system. Finally, the review deliberated the limits of the existing works and summaries the objectives that need to attain in the future air monitoring systems to make them more accurate and realistic.

AB Large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications involve diverse sensing devices collecting and transmitting massive amounts of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel compressive data aggregation and recovery mechanism that reduces the global communication cost without introducing computational overhead at the network nodes. Following the principles of compressive demixing, each node of the network collects measurement readings from multiple sources and mixes them with readings from other nodes into a single low-dimensional measurement vector, which is then relayed to other nodes; the constituent signals are recovered at the sink using convex optimization. Our design achieves significant reduction in the overall network data rates compared to prior schemes based on (distributed) compressed sensing or compressed sensing with (multiple) side information. Experiments using real large-scale air-quality data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework against state-of-the-art solutions, with and without the presence of measurement and transmission noise.

AB The 'Smart city' is an emerging concept in the last decade that covers many aspects of progressive city life. Many aspects of the Smart cities are inevitably related to ICT or more precisely to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we cover a smart environment and smart mobility in cities through a mobile application, sensors and web services that cover these aspects in smart cities. Having this in mind, we propose our IoT/Cloud-based 'Smart city' air pollution monitoring system. As the main contribution of this paper, we have designed and implemented a mobile application for air pollution indicators control and corresponding visualization. Additional novelty is the real time recommendations provided by our mobile application on the basis of air pollution parameters value.

ID CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emergent paradigm characterized by a plethora of smart objects connected to the Internet. An inherent characteristic of IoT is the high heterogeneity and the wide distribution of objects, thereby calling for ways to describe in an unambiguous and machine-interpretable way the resources provided by objects, their properties, and the services they offer. In this context, discovery services play a significant role as they allow clients (middle-ware platforms, end-users, applications) to retrieve available resources based on appropriate search criteria, such as resource type, capabilities, location, and Quality of Context (QoC) parameters. To cope with these concerns, we introduce QoDisco, a QoC-aware discovery service relying on multiple-attribute searches, range queries, and synchronous/asynchronous operations. QoDisco also comprises an ontology-based information model for semantically describing resources, services, and QoC-related information. In this paper, we describe the QoDisco architecture and information model as well as an evaluation of the search procedure in an urban air pollution monitoring scenario.

AB The Internet of things (IoT) is highly suitable for military, environmental, agricultural, and other remote real-time monitoring applications. A reliable topology ensures a stable and dependable monitoring system. Considering the research of an IoT-based air pollution monitoring system for industrial emissions as background, this study proposes a novel dual redundant node deployment scheme. Specifically, hexagonal clustering is proposed for the internal regions. In addition, relationship and quantification formulas for a monitoring area are presented, and the communication range, total number of layers of the topology, and number of cluster headers are determined Interruptions in a monitoring system may reduce the quality of IoT services. Therefore, sensor nodes are also deployed around the monitoring area (in outer regions). The basic external area is modeled and proposed as a rectangular, 1-covered isosceles triangle deployment plan with the objective of minimizing the number of sensor nodes. A quantitative formula is given using the sensing radius, width of the rectangle, and adjacent distance between nodes. Reliability is a critical index in IoT-based applications. Thus, the reliability of a hexagonal clustering topology is presented using reliability block diagrams. For a reliable remote transmission model, different redundant systems are implemented. Furthermore, the reliability value and mean time to failures are calculated. The results are later compared and analyzed quantitatively. This study presents important theoretical and application-based knowledge that can guarantee reliable service for an IoT-based monitoring system.

AB In the era of industrialization, pollutants in the air are increasing at an alarming rate causing serious threats to mankind. This has raised a need of measuring and recording pollution levels to initiate planned actions so as to protect the environment. Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing are two of the emerging technologies with enormous potentials that can be utilized for this purpose. Therefore, in this paper we propose an IoT based Air Pollution Monitoring (APM) system whose components are deployed at all critical locations within the city. An upcoming, long-range communication medium LoRa is used as the backbone of our APM system. Our system not only allows passersby to view pollution status of his/her surrounding through an appropriate Android application but also informs the corresponding authorities in case of an emergency. Through real-time data collection and performance evaluation we show how our proposed system satisfies the necessary criteria. Finally, we also provide a detailed comparison of why we prefer LoRa over WiFi (the traditional medium of wireless communication) and how it is beneficial, cost-effective in case of large deployment areas.

AB Wireless sensor network is one of the important areas where a lot of work is being done. The work is not limited to fire detection and propagation of fire, air pollution, water or gas leakage detection but many more. If WSN is used in conjunction with Internet of Things (IOT), the shared information will be more useful. Internet of things is nothing but a combination of sensor and software with the embedded electronics. The data collected in a local area can he sent at any distance where it can be seen and further controlling action may be initiated if required. The WSN based air monitoring system collects the data from the area where the sensors are deployed and the data can be displayed on the computer screen. The computer data can be sent to any terminal which is connected to Internet. Hence by using IOT, the long distance transmission of the data can be done. The monitoring is limited to area but the information can he forwarded to any control station. Hence by using IOT, the air pollution level of the campus even cities can be monitored and necessary advisory can be issued if required.

AB The Internet of Things paradigm originates from the proliferation of intelligent devices that can sense, compute and communicate data streams in a ubiquitous information and communication network. The great amounts of data coming from these devices introduce some challenges related to the storage and processing capabilities of the information. This strengthens the novel paradigm known as Big Data. In such a complex scenario, the Cloud computing is an efficient solution for the managing of sensor data. This paper presents Polluino, a system for monitoring the air pollution via Arduino. Moreover, a Cloud-based platform that manages data coming from air quality sensors is developed.

AB The recent years have witnessed increase in air pollution levels throughout the world. Long term exposure to pollutants in air leads to chronic heart and lung diseases in biological organisms. Therefore monitoring the air pollution has become important. Increase in the human population, usage of fossil fuels, industrialization, vehicles, etc. directly affect the air pollution level and in turn the human health. The air quality level can be monitored using the Internet of Things (IoT). It is a network where uniquely identified things are connected to transfer information and communicates using the Internet protocol. This paper proposes an IoT based air pollution monitoring system and gives an overview of the hardware setup of the proposed system.

AB This study addresses the design of smart sensor system aided bicycle that can be exploited as a platform for the acquisition of real-time data. In particular, in this work, the authors address the pressing issues like air pollution monitoring and health monitoring by using sensors that were seen as limitations in the already existing smart e-bike monitoring system. The sensor system presented in this study is capable of monitoring parameters such as location, heart rate of the rider and air quality levels in real-time. The data thus collected is fed into Thingspeak, an open Internet of Things platform powered by Matlab. The data is then visually represented in an Android application for riders to view and analyse the monitored parameters. The Android application designed for the system assists the user with location tracking, pollution mapping and health monitoring. Furthermore, security is also considered in this work which is addressed with the help of a fingerprint sensor and a global system for mobile/global positioning system module to alert the user in case of system theft. The system attached to the bicycle can be implemented on a large scale as a fleet/bike sharing system in order to map the pollution of an entire city with the help of IoT, thus aiding the development of greenfield smart city and additionally monitoring the vitals of the user riding the bicycle leading to intelligent transportation system. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, enlists the outcomes of the system and explores the future scope and development.

AB Concept of interactive on-line system was developed for environmental monitoring of traffic jam. The core of the interactive monitoring system is a calculation module, which calculates the field of air pollution and health risk. The calculation is based on the actual traffic jam flow velocity data and on the actual weather conditions data. On-line estimation of jam velocity are included in public services of yandex.ru and doroga tv. The calculated traffic intensity is based on the estimated traffic jam flow velocity. Wind speed and wind direction on-line measurements are available on special request from hydrometeorological service. Calculation of pollutant concentrations are based on Gaussian dispersion model in the modification of Pasquill-Gifford. Calculations of health risk are based on Russian official procedures. The calculated pollutant concentrations for the billing period and risks of immediate and chronic toxicological effects could be provided to the user via internet or intranet. Proposed solution is internet of things including GPS beacons at vehicles, embedded digital units at meteorological stations, calculation module and client-server interface.

AB This paper proposes a framework for an Air Quality Decision Support System (AQDSS), and as a proof of concept, develops an Internet of Things (IoT) application based on this framework. This application was assessed by means of a case study in the City of Madrid. We employed different sensors and combined outdoor and indoor data with spatiotemporal activity patterns to estimate the Personal Air Pollution Exposure (PAPE) of an individual. This pilot case study presents evidence that PAPE can be estimated by employing indoor air quality monitors and e-beacon technology that have not previously been used in similar studies and have the advantages of being low-cost and unobtrusive to the individual. In future work, our IoT application can be extended to include prediction models, enabling dynamic feedback about PAPE risks. Furthermore, PAPE data from this type of application could be useful for air quality policy development as well as in epidemiological studies that explore the effects of air pollution on certain diseases.

DE Indoor Air Pollution; IoT; NodeMCU
AB The term " Air Pollution" generally refers to the outdoor air pollution, mainly caused by combustion of fossil fuels by industrial plants, smog, and emissions from cars and trucks. But the air indoors can also be polluted. Indoor air pollution refers to the contamination of indoor air. It may cause harmful health issues. The main sources of indoor air pollution are pesticides, chimneys which contain pollutants such as particulate matter, biomass smoke, fireplaces, moulds, and environmental tobacco smoke. The pollutants are nitrogen dioxide(NO2), Ammonia, sulphur dioxide(SO2), radon, carbon monoxide(CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and benzene. In this Internet of Things(IoT) project, wireless air pollution monitoring system is built, which sends alerts to the user by using the Internet, when the concentration of pollutants measured goes beyond safer level. This system can be preferred over the existing systems because the alerts sent by the system can be received by the user on mobile phone from any distance irrespective of whether it is connected to the Internet. The microcontroller used is the NodeMCU Dev board v1.0 which consist of ESP8266, Wi-Fi enabled chip. The sensor used is MQ135, air quality sensor, which along with microcontroller can be used to monitor the pollution indoors.

AB With the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of monitoring applications deployed is considerably increasing, whatever the field considered: smart city, smart agriculture, environment monitoring, air pollution monitoring, to name a few. The LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)architecture with its long range communication, its robustness to interference and its reduced energy consumption is an excellent candidate to support such applications. However, if the number of end devices is high, the reliability of LoRaWAN, measured by the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), becomes unacceptable due to an excessive number of collisions. In this paper, we propose two different families of solutions ensuring collision-free transmissions. The first family is TDMA (Time-Division Multiple Access)-based. All clusters transmit in sequence and up to six end devices with different spreading factors belonging to the same cluster are allowed to transmit in parallel. The second family is FDMA (Frequency Divsion Multiple Access)-based. All clusters transmit in parallel, each cluster on its own frequency. Within each cluster, all end devices transmit in sequence. Their performance are compared in terms of PDR, energy consumption by end device and maximum number of end devices supported. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical results and show the high efficiency of the solutions proposed.

AB Air Pollution is a harsh reality of today's times. With rapid industrialization and urbanization, the polluting gases emitted by the burning of fossil fuels in industries, factories and vehicles, cities around the world have become "gas chambers". Unfortunately, New Delhi too happens to be among the most polluted cities in the world. The present paper designs and demonstrates an IoT(Internet of Things) based smart air pollution monitoring system that could be installed at various junctions and high traffic zones in urban metropolis and megalopolis to monitor pollution locally. It is designed in a novelistic way that not just monitors air pollution by taking varied inputs from various sensors (temperature, humidity, smoke, Carbon monoxide, gas) and but also presents it on a smart mirror. Its unique feature is the demonstration of a smog prediction model by determining PM10 (Particulate Matter 10) concentration using the most efficient machine learning model after an extensive comparison by taking into account environmental conditions. This data generated can also be sent as a feedback to the traffic department to avoid incessant rush and to maintain uniform flow of traffic and also to environmental agencies to keep pollution levels under check.

AB Air pollution poses significant risk to environment and health. Air quality monitoring stations are often confined to a small number of locations due to the high cost of the monitoring equipment. They provide a low fidelity picture of the air quality in the city; local variations are overlooked. However, recent developments in low-cost sensor technology and wireless communication systems like Internet of Things (IoT) provide an opportunity to use arrayed sensor networks to measure air pollution, in real time, at a large number of locations. This article reports the development of a novel low-cost sensor node that utilizes cost-effective electrochemical sensors to measure carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and an infrared sensor to measure particulate matter (PM) levels. The node can be powered by either solar-recharged battery or mains supply. It is capable of long-range, low power communication over public or private long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) IoT network and short-range high data rate communication over Wi-Fi. The developed sensor nodes were co-located with an accurate reference CO sensor for field calibration. The low-cost sensors' data, with offset and gain calibration, show good correlation with the data collected from the reference sensor. Multiple linear regression (MLR)-based temperature and humidity correction results in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 48.71% and R-2 of 0.607 relative to the reference sensor's data. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based calibration shows the potential for significant further improvement with MAPE of 38.89% and R-2 of 0.78 for leave-one-out cross-validation.

AB In the automobile sector, the new advancements in technology help the vendors in developing smart vehicles. These smart vehicles are designed to provide all sort of comfort to the society. But still, some improvements are required to make these vehicles smarter in terms of environmental pollution management. The other cause of air pollution is due to the toxic gases released by the industries. The environment pollution is still increasing gradually despite the various efforts of government. A number of solutions are available in the literature to control and monitor environmental pollution. The examination uncovers that there is a necessity of a sensor based embedded system that can screen and control the air contamination with generation of challan from anyplace in the world using IOT. An embedded system prototype has been designed on the concept of an internet of things scenario that uses sensors and actuators around Raspberry Pi board. The system prototype is programmed in python using some standard libraries available on adafruit and github. A web page is also designed to monitor the level of gases remotely at any place in the world. The results demonstrate that the complete system has been successfully tested and implemented.

AB The main objective of this system is to design and implement a Wi-Fi based plug and sense smart device for dedicated air pollution monitoring using Internet of Things simply called as IoT. This system designed on device to cloud architecture in IoT for monitoring air pollution precisely. Once the sensor node reads individual pollutants composition and location coordinates, Air quality index (AQI) will be calculated using linear segmented principle with greater Vancouver AQI table and Max operator aggregation method. Based on AQI value, corresponding LED will be actuated for indication and health impact with precaution steps messages will be displayed on the screen. All those data will be pushed to thingspeak cloud storage an open source application programming interface for IoT based devices. These pushed data along with date and time can be retrieved as a separate excel sheet for future analysis. Through thingview android app, real time pollution level with location can be visualized in terms of line graph. With the implementation of this low cost and small size smart device, alert can be given to people to wear anti-pollution mask and reroute path in transportation where there is high air pollution ensuring high reliability and consistency.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology where physical entities are integrated with internet, sensors and communicating technology in order to enrich our lives and make it simple. IoT is employed in home automation, monitoring environmental parameters, industries, vehicles, medical sector, etc. In this paper, we consider the application of IoT in air pollution monitoring system. Increase in pollution levels in the environment adversely affects all forms of life in it. Hence it is extremely important to monitor and control the pollution level. This paper proposes a model to deploy the IoT devices to measure the pollution level in a given region. The region is partitioned into grids and each grid is assigned a priority. Since the devices are expensive and are to be used minimally, such an approach would make the best use of these devices. Simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The quality of air plays a predominant role in human health and has greater influence on life expectancy. In our project, five different gas sensors are used to evaluate the quality of air. The quality of air is classified into good, moderate, unhealthy, and hazardous. For instance, this work has been conducted in Coimbatore (smart city). The presence of harmful gases determines the nature of the air and this classification can be monitored periodically by measuring the amount of SO2 and NO2, which acts as a vital parameter. These measured and classified data can be transferred to public access and decision can be taken, so that we have developed an open access website to store and display the values of classified air quality. This information to the people can be used to improve quality of life by improving the quality of air.

AB With technologies developed in the Internet of Things, embedded devices can be built into every fabric of urban environments and connected to each other; and data continuously produced by these devices can be processed, integrated at different levels, and made available in standard formats through open services. The data, obviously f a form of "big data", is now seen as the most valuable asset in developing intelligent applications. As the sizes of the IoT data continue to grow, it becomes inefficient to transfer all the raw data to a centralised, cloud-based data centre and to perform efficient analytics even with the state-of-the-art big data processing technologies. To address the problem, this article demonstrates the idea of "distributed intelligence" for sensor data computing, which disperses intelligent computation to the much smaller while autonomous units, e.g., sensor network gateways, smart phones or edge clouds in order to reduce data sizes and to provide high quality data for data centres. As these autonomous units are usually in close proximity to data consumers, they also provide potential for reduced latency and improved quality of services. We present our research on designing methods and apparatus for distributed computing on sensor data, e.g., acquisition, discovery, and estimation, and provide a case study on urban air pollution monitoring and visualisation.

AB Internet of Things has been providential in tackling a lot of problems that amassed a lot of attention and concern among people. A lot of consumer electronics today have multiple IoT subsystems functioning in them, that not only make a product smart, but also increases its value as a product. Air pollution is a very serious problem, that has proved its deleteriousness over the past few years. With a lot of densely populated cities, now branded as unsafe for people to live in, due mainly to the polluted air it is home to, the importance for a solution that alerts city dwellers about the air quality of a space is gaining momentum. IoT, however could solve this problem, by educating people about the air quality, after measuring them. A dedicated air pollution monitoring device will not be effective enough in making people accept that an air quality monitor is a necessity and not a luxury. Therefore, this work integrates an air pollution monitoring system into a wearable like a watch that also doubles as a fitness tracker and a temperature monitor. Air pollutant levels, footsteps taken and ambient temperature are all sensed and displayed by the smart watch proposed in this work and is also casted to a custom designed smartphone application. The device proposed is novel in what it can do at the extremely low cost that it takes for its build. Thus a watch that can do everything that other watches can and cannot do has been proposed, with a tight integration to a smartphone app.

AB Nowadays, thanks to the hardware costs reduction everyone at home owns at least one hi-technology devices to support life quality. This paper proposes a new methodology to analyse the indoor air quality with a cheap and third-age-dedicated device. A new prototype, called Home Pollution Embedded System (HOPES), was developed to give simple and understandable information, also comprehensible for people with cognitive problems or that are not familiar with new technologies. The device gathers pollutants data and displays to the user different air pollutants concentrations, from toxics gasses up to explosives. Moreover, an overall air quality index has been elaborated and is displayed by HOPES with lights and numerical information. HOPES is an Internet of things device that works in real time and that can be connected to the web and to a geographic information system platform to add spatial information of each pollutant. The hardware architecture employs a set of gas semiconductor sensors and an IR particulate matter sensor. Experimental results demonstrated that HOPES has an accurate sensor response and is suitable to be used with the proposed indices. In fact, despite of the poor-selective metal oxide sensors, the results highlighted how it is possible to get useful air quality information with a cheap device. However, the system needs more tests to validate the sensors array with different substances.

AB During the last decade, the Wireless Sensor Networks have been considered as a broad solution for Internet of Things (IoT) based systems such as noise and air pollution monitoring systems. These systems should be able to monitor the physical variables regularly and simultaneously, to react immediately upon the occurrence of an emergency, and to report the event and its associated data to an observer, in a reliable and energy-efficient way. Recently, the MultiModal Wireless Sensor Networks (M2WSNs) have been proposed as a solution for monitoring oriented applications with low bandwidth requirements that operate simultaneously under normal circumstances and emergencies. In this paper, we present a reliable and energy-efficiency framework for M2WSNs based on the IoT and the Wake-up Radio paradigms. The framework is implemented in ContikiOS, an open-source operating system for IoT solutions, and its performance is evaluated in hardware in an indoor testbed. The experimental results show that the proposed framework provides better reliability in terms of the event reporting latency and packet delivery ratio. Besides, a significant energy-saving is achieved when considering a broadcast-based wake-up scheme with one communication hop for data transmission and acknowledgment procedures in a multi-hop network, compared to a single-radio approach based on a traditional low-duty-cycling and networking techniques.

AB Air pollution is a growing global concern that affects the health and livelihood of millions of people worldwide. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made available a plethora of data sources that provide near real-time information on air pollution. Many studies and systems have taken advantage of data stemming from the IoT and have been dedicated to enhancing the monitoring and prediction of air quality, from a fairly analytical angle, often disregarding the user's perspective in processing and presenting this data. In this paper, we research and present a novel context-aware air quality monitoring and prediction system called My Air Quality Index (MyAQI). MyAQI takes into consideration user's context (e.g. health conditions, individual sensitivities and preferences) to tailor the visualisation and notifications. We propose a context model that is used to combine user's context with air pollution data to provide context-aware recommendations to the specific user. MyAQI also incorporates a prediction algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) to predict future air quality. MyAQI is implemented as a web-based application and has the capability to consume data from a wide range of data sources including IoT devices and open data sources (via Application Programming Interfaces (API)). We demonstrate the context-aware visualisation techniques implemented in MyAQI, which adapt to changing user's context, and validate the performance of the air quality prediction algorithm.

AB Problems related to the monitoring of environmental parameters, and in particular air-pollution in urban agglomerations, are some of the more publicly discussed public issues in recent times. This paper presents the concept, functionality, main hardware and software components, and test results of low-cost prototype of the system, enabling monitoring of environmental parameters such as air-pollution, temperature, humidity, pressure and UV radiation. The main features of this solution are its low cost, relatively high precision of measurement and the ability to operate in mobile version, without wired power supply and communication, including GPS coordinates as one of the measured parameters. The prototype can be an alternative to expensive professional solutions and a base for developing more advanced sensor networks. For home use it can be used as a home weather station with an air pollution sensor, being an extension of the of Personal Area Network of the recently popular Internet of Things solutions.

AB With the swift growth in commerce and transportation in the modern civilization, much attention has been paid to air quality monitoring, however existing monitoring systems are unable to provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions of the data with cost efficient and real time solutions. In this paper we have investigated the issues, infrastructure, computational complexity, and procedures of designing and implementing real-time air quality monitoring systems. To daze the defects of the existing monitoring systems and to decrease the overall cost, this paper devised a novel approach to implement the air quality monitoring system, employing the edge-computing based Internet-of-Things (IoT). In the proposed method, sensors gather the air quality data in real time and transmit it to the edge computing device that performs necessary processing and analysis. The complete infrastructure & prototype for evaluation is developed over the Arduino board and IBM Watson IoT platform. Our model is structured in such a way that it reduces the computational burden over sensing nodes (reduced to 70%) that is battery powered and balanced it with edge computing device that has its local data base and can be powered up directly as it is deployed indoor. Algorithms were employed to avoid temporary errors in low cost sensor, and to manage cross sensitivity problems. Automatic calibration is set up to ensure the accuracy of the sensors reporting, hence achieving data accuracy around 75-80% under different circumstances. In addition, a data transmission strategy is applied to minimize the redundant network traffic and power consumption. Our model acquires a power consumption reduction up to 23% with a significant low cost. Experimental evaluations were performed under different scenarios to validate the system's effectiveness.

AB The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the generation of tremendous amounts of data from various sources. Cloud based systems are effective in storage and application of machine learning algorithms on such datasets. However, in some cases it is important to enable real time processing for making immediate decisions. There are many applications which require instantaneous analysis of the generated data for remedies in event of an anomaly. Data associated with such use cases remains significant only for a short duration of time.
   Various electronic sensors, e.g. Temperature, Moisture, Air Quality, Pressure, Wind Velocity etc. present in a Wireless Sensor Network generate streams of values. It can be processed using pipelines which provide prompt and quick analysis for decision making. Stream Processing Systems can be helpful in such cases as they analyse data streams within a few milliseconds to a few seconds.
   In this paper, we discuss an event based processing of streaming data from air pollution sensors to create a real time anomaly detection system. To reduce the delays associated with the generation of alarms in our pipeline, Apache Foundation's Stream Processing Tools, Kafka and Flink were used for operations on our streams. To further accelerate the process, all the analysis is conducted on an embedded edge computing gateway device rather than sending data to the cloud for batch processing. The results are obtained in the form of a geographical map visualization using ELK stack. The map highlights the coordinates of the location with an unhealthy air quality index in real time.

AB The rapid growth of industry and transport within this contemporary progress, there was sufficient con-sideration given to air quality monitoring; but conventional air quality monitoring methods are inefficient to produce adequate spatial and temporal resolutions of the air quality information by cost-effective also the period time clarifications. During the paper, we propose a distinct methodology to achieve the air quality monitoring system, using this fog computing-based Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper pro-posed an embedded system, where sensors collect the air quality information within period time and send it over the fog nodes. Every fog node may be an extraordinarily virtualized program hosted at a committed computing node implemented with a connection interface. Data gathered by Microprocessor based IoT sensing things do not seem to be causing on into the cloud server to the process. Preferably, they do send through the adjacent fog node to get quick, including high-rise rate service. Though, fog node will refine non-actionable data (e.g., regular device measurement) also forward them to the Cloud for lengthy run storage and batch analytics. The Cloud may be a convenient location to run world an-alytics at information gathered from commonly shared devices over sustained periods (months, years). General purpose processor (microprocessor) and IoT cloud platforms were involved in developing this whole infrastructure and model for analysis. Empirical outcomes reveal that this advanced method is re-sponsible for sensing air quality, which serves to expose the modification patterns regarding air quality through a certain level.

AB Air pollution has become a major environmental issue in large cities. Air pollutants, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has raised various concerns on human health. As a result, several low-cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed worldwide. However, an accurate air pollution monitoring system profoundly relies on data quality. In this paper, we propose RL-PMAgg for robustly computing PM2.5 pollution rates in existence of faulty sensors. Our method consists of three modules. The outlier detector gives quality assessments to the measurements. We use an RL-based trust management system to create a profile for each sensor and track its behavior in the long run. Then, an aggregated PM2.5 rate is computed by using a set of honest sensors along with their trust levels and measurements. We evaluate RL-PMAgg on both simulated and real-world datasets. We compare the proposed method with relevant works. Experimental results show that RL-PMAgg resists the majority of attacks as compared with other works. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale data collection by means of wireless sensor network and Internet-of-Things technology poses various challenges in view of the limitations in transmission, computation, and energy resources of the associated wireless devices. Compressive data gathering based on compressed sensing has been proven a well-suited solution to the problem. Existing designs exploit the spatiotemporal correlations among data collected by a specific sensing modality. However, many applications, such as environmental monitoring, involve collecting heterogeneous data that are intrinsically correlated. In this paper, we propose to leverage the correlation from multiple heterogeneous signals when recovering the data from compressive measurements. To this end, we propose a novel recovery algorithm-built upon belief-propagation principles-that leverages correlated information from multiple heterogeneous signals. To efficiently capture the statistical dependencies among diverse sensor data, the proposed algorithm uses the statistical model of copula functions. Experiments with heterogeneous air-pollution sensor measurements show that the proposed design provides significant performance improvements against the state-of-the-art compressive data gathering and recovery schemes that use classical compressed sensing, compressed sensing with side information, and distributed compressed sensing.

AB Air pollution has emerged as a major threat to public health. Due to vehicular pollution and industries, the exposure to toxic particulate matter pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) is alarmingly high in major cities. Silver birch trees are good in absorbing the PM in the air. The characteristics of silver birch trees are briefed in this paper. The present study analyses the air quality standards and compares it with various pollutant parameters and health inferences. The PM values are also analysed globally and nationally. In this paper, we have analysed and then suggested to monitor and minimize air pollution parameter especially particulate matter by planting silver birch trees in urban cities. Reducing emissions of particulate matter not only has an instant effect on air quality, but also moderates climate change. By controlling the environmental pollution, the cities are devoid of health issues and other harmful effects. Further by using the technologies of Internet of Things and cloud computing, the measured sensor values are suggested to store in cloud storage and communicated to the authorities. Hence, it will be monitored continuously and helps to save the environment.

AB In this study, a mobile air pollution sensing unit based on the Internet of Things framework was designed for monitoring the concentration of fine particulate matter in three urban areas. This unit was developed using the NodeMCU-32S microcontroller, PMS5003-G5 (particulate matter sensing module), and Ublox NEO-6M V2 (GPS positioning module). The sensing unit transmits data of the particulate matter concentration and coordinates of a polluted location to the backend server through 3G and 4G telecommunication networks for data collection. This system will complement the government's PM2.5 data acquisition system. Mobile monitoring stations meet the air pollution monitoring needs of some areas that require special observation. For example, an AIoT development system will be installed. At intersections with intensive traffic, it can be used as a reference for government transportation departments or environmental inspection departments for environmental quality monitoring or evacuation of traffic flow. Furthermore, the particulate matter distributions in three areas, namely Xinzhuang, Sanchong, and Luzhou Districts, which are all in New Taipei City of Taiwan, were estimated using machine learning models, the data of stationary monitoring stations, and the measurements of the mobile sensing system proposed in this study. Four types of learning models were trained, namely the decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function neural network, and their prediction results were evaluated. The root mean square error was used as the performance indicator, and the learning results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other models for both the training and testing sets. To examine the generalizability of the learning models, the models were verified in relation to data measured on three days: 15 February, 28 February, and 1 March 2019. A comparison between the model predicted and the measured data indicates that the random forest model provides the most stable and accurate prediction values and could clearly present the distribution of highly polluted areas. The results of these models are visualized in the form of maps by using a web application. The maps allow users to understand the distribution of polluted areas intuitively.</p>

AB Air pollution and its harm to human health has become a serious problem in many cities around the world. In recent years, research interests in measuring and predicting the quality of air around people has spiked. Since the Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in different domains to improve the quality life for people by connecting multiple sensors in different places, it also makes the air pollution monitoring more easier than before. Traditional way of using fixed sensors cannot effectively provide a comprehensive view of air pollution in people & x2019;s immediate surroundings, since the closest sensors can be possibly miles away. Our research focuses on modeling the air quality pattern in a given region by adopting both fixed and moving IoT sensors, which are placed on vehicles patrolling around the region. With our approach, a full spectrum of how air quality varies in nearby regions can be analyzed. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in effectively measuring and predicting air quality using different machine learning algorithms with real world data. Our evaluation shows a promising result for effective air quality monitoring and prediction for a smart city application.

AB Mobile Internet of things (MIoT) applications serving smart cities bring the promise of innovative and enhanced public services such as air pollution monitoring, enhanced road safety and city resources metering and management. These applications rely on a number of energy-constrained MIoT units (MUs) (e.g., robots and drones) to continuously sense, capture and process data and images from their environments to produce immediate adaptive actions. In this paper, we consider a scenario where a battery constrained MU executes a number of time-sensitive data processing tasks whose arrival times and sizes are stochastic in nature. We first formulate the problem of making optimal offloading decisions that minimize the cost of current and future tasks as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that accounts for the constraints of the MU battery and the limited reserved resources on the MEC infrastructure by the application providers. Next, we show how the CMDP problem can be relaxed using Lagrangian primal-dual optimization. We then develop a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to train the MU to solve the relaxed problem. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the achieved performance improvement.

AB Air pollution is the evolving issue these days. It is mandatory to monitor the quality of air and keep it under control for better future and healthy living for all. Here the proposed system is an air quality surveillance system that allows us to monitor and provide live air quality in different areas through IOT (Internet of Things), when the pollution rate exceeds the threshold value warning alarm is given. System uses gas sensors (MQ-series) to sense the presence of harmful gases in the air that constantly transmit this data by interacting with the microcontroller and reports it to the online server over IOT. This allows experts to monitor air pollution in exclusive areas. To be specific this system would control the air pollution, using catalytic converters that converts toxic gases in the exhaust gas to less toxic pollutants by red ox reaction mechanism with the catalysts present inside it. The resultant gas undergoes zapping with laser which leads to the byproduct oxygen. The laser is activated manually when the carbon monoxide value exceeds a threshold value. Thus, the outcome of the implementation will be oxygen. The proposed system uses Arduino UNO R3, sensor devices, Embedded C and provide graphical analysis using Visual Basic.

ID AIR-POLLUTION
AB Commercially available crowdsourced air boxes have nonuniform distributions and cannot achieve suitable observation densities. As a result, current air quality data are limited to the vicinity of an observation station, rather than providing accurate actual data around a user. In this research, we propose the implementation of iAIR air pollution detection air boxes, which can be installed on air purifiers or air conditioners in large numbers and distributed over a wide area; this provides a real-time air pollution information map according to various air qualities and shows a higher resolution. The provided real-time information enables a user to immediately take appropriate response measures once poor air quality has been detected. When air quality degrades or the user's heart rate exceeds the normal range, the smart iAIR system installed on a cloud service platform will transmit warning messages to a mobile app and a wearable personal smart wristband, and at the same time, activate the air purifier (or air conditioner) to improve the current air quality and advise the user to move to an environment with better air quality with guidance by an air navigation map.

AB In this paper, we describe the main outcomes of AGILE (acronym for "Adaptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments"), an EU-funded project that recently delivered a modular hardware and software framework conceived to address the fragmented market of embedded, multi-service, adaptive gateways for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its main goal is to provide a low-cost solution capable of supporting proof-of-concept implementations and rapid prototyping methodologies for both consumer and industrial IoT markets. AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels. We illustrate how the AGILE framework can provide a cost-effective yet solid and highly customizable, technological foundation supporting the configuration, deployment, and assessment of two distinct showcases, namely a quantified self application for individual consumers, and an air pollution monitoring station for industrial settings.

AB The emergence of the Internet of things (IoT) facilitates us to connect all the devices available at home. Also, we can control and access devices and appliances remotely in real time. This article, by taking the advantages of IoT, proposes an IoT-based affordable air quality monitoring with smart home system that brings controlling and monitoring of devices and appliances, and monitoring of home environment together in real time. The system uses the combination of wireless communication and cloud networking, to remote control various appliances (like fans, TV), also getting a glimpse of air quality. In order to monitor the home environment, we develop a practical information acquisition model, a network for indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring which can be carried anywhere as a portable device. The portable nodes can sense pollutants like CO, CO2, PM 2.5, PM 10 with temperature and humidity and monitor the air quality. The collected data are sent to a cloud service platform like things speak and Firebase for real-time visualization and appropriate forecasting and prediction analytics. Also, a user-friendly Android app and web portal increase the usability of this system. Moreover, when critical conditions occur, an alert is reflected on the android app and on web portal in real time. Also, the system starts sending a warning ring on registered mobile.

AB In recent years, several research projects have investigated the use of low-cost devices for air pollution monitoring. As a result of these activities, various air quality monitoring systems have been developed following diverse approaches and methods. However, in most cases, these monitoring systems lack flexibility, extendibility, and openness. The device presented in this article provides a cost-effective, expandable, flexible, open-source solution. SentinAir has been designed to act as a portable air quality monitoring unit and also for facilitating the on-field evaluation and calibration of air quality sensors. The high grade of flexibility featuring this tool enables the data acquisition from heterogeneous kinds of devices deployed far from the laboratory facilities, even in areas featured by a weak or unstable Internet connection. Moreover, the system proposed in this article provides a reasonably easy way to integrate a wide range of sensors or devices produced by diverse manufacturers, offering a tool that is not bound to the use of a limited and fixed set of sensors or devices. The modularity approach followed in SentinAir design constitutes another key factor to consider: it allows each user to easily adapt this device to his requirements. This system is therefore capable of providing a robust framework for environmental monitoring activities to researchers or low-skilled end-users. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Air pollution is one of the major concerns considering detriments to human health. This type of pollution leads to several health problems for humans, such as asthma, heart issues, skin diseases, bronchitis, lung cancer, and throat and eye infections. Air pollution also poses serious issues to the planet. Pollution from the vehicle industry is the cause of greenhouse effect and CO2 emissions. Thus, real-time monitoring of air pollution in these areas will help local authorities to analyze the current situation of the city and take necessary actions. The monitoring process has become efficient and dynamic with the advancement of the Internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Localization is the main issue in WSNs; if the sensor node location is unknown, then coverage and power and routing are not optimal. This study concentrates on localization-based air pollution prediction systems for real-time monitoring of smart cities. These systems comprise two phases considering the prediction as heavy or light traffic area using the Gaussian support vector machine algorithm based on the air pollutants, such as PM2.5 particulate matter, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The sensor nodes are localized on the basis of the predicted area using the meta-heuristic algorithms called fast correlation-based elephant herding optimization. The dataset is divided into training and testing parts based on 10 cross-validations. The evaluation on predicting the air pollutant for localization is performed with the training dataset. Mean error prediction in localizing nodes is 9.83 which is lesser than existing solutions and accuracy is 95%.

AB In the past years, multiple research projects have explored the potential of low-cost environmental sensors for urban air pollution monitoring. However, each project has taken its own independent and in many cases, fully or partially closed approach. We present the Smart Citizen System, a flexible, easy-to-use and fully open-source environmental monitoring solution for particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, noise levels, and many other indicators. The use of low-cost sensors in recent years has been generally approached in two different ways citizen science and educational activities, where the primary purpose is to engage citizens in the measurement process and raise awareness of environmental concerns; and a more sophisticated scientific approach, where the main aim is to study the potentiality of the low-cost sensing technologies. The Smart Citizen System balances modularity with integration to fulfil both needs by providing an extendable solution, with different ranges of sensors based on the same core components. With that aim, two solutions have been developed: the Smart Citizen Kit, intended for citizen science and awareness activities; and the Smart Citizen Station, designed to serve as a more complex and accurate set of air pollution sensors. The design is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated storage platform and a sensor analysis framework. The core system bases its sensing capabilities in widely reviewed low-cost sensors and aims to provide a robust framework for environmental monitoring activities. By making everything open, from the hardware to the software platform or the sensor post-processing algorithms, we hope others might find it useful as a development platform allowing them to focus on their project particular needs instead of reinventing everything from the ground-up.

AB In this study, we analysed a data set from 10 low-cost PM2.5 sensors using the Internet of Things (IoT) for air quality monitoring in Mae Sot, which is one of the most vulnerable areas for high PM2.5 concentration in Thailand, during the 2018 burning season. Our objectives were to understand the nature of the plume movement and to investigate possibilities of adopting IoT sensors for near real-time forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations. Sensor data including PM2.5 and meteorological parameters (wind speed and direction) were collected online every 2 min where data were grouped into four zones and averaged every 15 min interval. Results of diurnal profile plot revealed that PM2.5 concentrations were high around early to late morning (3:00-9:00) and gradually reduced till the rest of the day. During the biomass burning period, maximum daily average concentration recorded by the sensors was 280 mu g/m(3) at Thai Samakkhi while the minimum was 13 mu g/m(3) at Mae Sot. Lag time concentrations, attributed by biomass burning (hot spots), significantly influenced the formation of PM2.5 while the disappearance of PM2.5 was found to be influenced by moderate wind speed. The PM2.5 concentrations of the next 15 min at the downwind zone (MG) were predicted using lag time concentrations with different wind categories. The next 15 min predictions of PM2.5 at MG were found to be mainly influenced by its lag time concentrations (MG_Lag); with higher wind speed, however, the lag time concentrations from the upwind zones (MS_Lag and TS_Lag) started to show more influence. From this study, we have found that low-cost IoT sensors provide not only real-time monitoring information but also demonstrate great potential as an effective tool to understand the PM2.5 plume movement with temporal variation and geo-specific location.
